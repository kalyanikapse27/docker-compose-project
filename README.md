# docker_compose_project
Project created for docker compose

**Project Overview**

In this project, weâ€™ll create a simple web application using Docker Compose, consisting of two services: Nginx as the web server and MySQL as the database server. The web application serves a static HTML page and connects to the MySQL database to retrieve sample data.

Docker Compose is a tool provided by Docker that simplifies the process of defining, managing, and orchestrating multi-container Docker applications. It allows developers to describe the services, networks, and volumes required for their applications in a single YAML file called docker-compose.yml. With Docker Compose, you can define complex application architectures with multiple interconnected containers, making it easy to replicate development, testing, and production environments.
